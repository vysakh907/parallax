    <h3>TEA</h3>
    <p class="p2">Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern China and northern Myanmar. Tea is also made, but rarely, from the leaves of Camellia taliensis.</p>

    <h3>COFFEE</h3>
    <p class="p2">A freshly pulled shot of espresso layered with steamed whole milk and thick rich foam to offer a luxurious velvety texture and complex aroma.Perfected and made popular during both World Wars, a cappuccino starts with a bottom layer of one or two shots of espresso (typically two in the United States). A second layer of steamed milk is added on top, followed by a thick and airy layer of foam to lend the drink a luxurious velvety texture</p>

    <h3>DONUTS</h3>
    <p class="p2">Flavor and fragrance ought to be distinctive, well-balanced - sweet but not cloying - and appealing enough to demand a second bite. If it's a raised donut, a whiff of yeastiness promises authentic, old-fashioned goodness.</p>
